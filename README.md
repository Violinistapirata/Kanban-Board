### Èric Masip 

I’ve been playing the violin for over 20 years, which has taught me
discipline, teamwork skills, and an eye for detail. Today, my
passion is web development: after completing Ironhack, I trained as
a MERN Fullstack Developer, mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
Node.js, React, Git/GitHub, OOP, TDD, and MongoDB. I love continuing
to learn and build new things. Outside of coding, I enjoy board
games 🎲, anime 👘, Latin dances 💃, and baking 🍪.
